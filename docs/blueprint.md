# **App Name**: Insight Stream

## Core Features:

- Product Data Display: Display product data.
- Real-time Search: Implement real-time search functionality using a search box that dynamically filters the displayed data as the user types.
- Data Sorting: Implement sorting options allowing users to sort product data based on different criteria such as price, date added, or popularity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to reflect data-driven focus and a sense of authority.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6EF), a desaturated tint of indigo for subtlety.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), an analogous color to indigo, creating visual interest.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif; Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif, creating a modern readable interface. The Space Grotesk would be applied sparingly.
- Use a set of consistent, modern icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons. Icons should primarily be in the violet accent color.
- Adopt a clean, card-based layout with generous whitespace. Prioritize data visibility.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations on data updates or when sorting and filtering for improved user experience.
